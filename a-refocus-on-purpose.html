						It’s September. The sprint to year-end is afoot and strategic business planning for 2024 is about to get fully underway. For the first time in four years, this will mean developing plans through a post-pandemic lens.<br><br>

						For forward-thinking, strategic-minded companies, it’s time to refocus on <strong>Purpose</strong>.<br><br>

						Purpose is a company’s North Star. It is the essential reason <i>why</i> a company exists, and how it contributes to the common good. As a meaningful strategic compass for addressing long-term planning and investing in the vitality of a business, Purpose can help drive a company's success and serve as a competitive wedge to help distinguish it in the market.
					</p>
					<div class='row'>
						<div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #ECF0F1;padding: 20px;">
							<br><br><h3 style="color:#4f89bb;"><i><strong>Purpose came into focus in the Fall of 2019.</strong></i></h3></h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							<p>Purpose first became a game-changer in the fall of 2019 when the Business Roundtable announced a new <a href='https://purpose.businessroundtable.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Statement on the Purpose of a Corporation.</a> It shifted the long-held singular focus on <i>shareholders</i> to a broader set of <i>stakeholders</i> including customers, employees, suppliers, and communities. 

								</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p class="sample-text">
						 Signed by leaders from 181 major companies, the statement made clear that the means for long-term business health and viability were being redefined.From Washington to Wall Street, the market took notice of this sea change. <br><br>

						 However, when COVID-19 emerged months later, companies needed to pivot, and full-scale Purpose efforts were derailed. Regardless, the pandemic only exacerbated the need to focus on select Purpose-related issues.
					</p>

					<br><br>
					<p class="text-center">
						<img src="img/purpose_compass.jpg" width='80%' alt="" class="img-fluid">
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="sample-text">
						So, as we now emerge from the wake of the last few years, Purpose is poised to once again take center stage. Building on efforts to date, it can help to steer future planning in the face of changing customer, market and economic demands.
						<br><br>
						All of this begs a few key questions:
					</p>

					<div class='row'>
						<div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #ECF0F1;padding: 20px;">
							<br><br><h3 style="color:#4f89bb;"><i><strong>How is a company's purpose determined?</strong></i></h3></h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							<p>The Japanese construct <a href='https://positivepsychology.com/ikigai/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Ikagai</a> defines the meaning of personal Purpose based on four key questions: What are you good at? What does the world need? What do you love? And why do you get paid?<br><br>

							This same basic construct, modified for companies, can be used by business leaders (see this  <a href='https://hbr.org/2021/11/putting-your-corporate-purpose-to-work#:~:text=Best%20Buy%E2%80%99s%20new%20purpose%20fundamentally%20changed%20our%20strategy,the%20key%20human%20needs%20we%20wanted%20to%20address.' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Harvard Business Review article</a>) to arrive at their corporate Purpose. Constructed of four pillars, Purpose is determined at the intersection of the following:
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<h4>Articulate the values of a business and what it is passionate about:</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">What does the company stand for and what drives employees – from top leadership down to the general employee base? It’s important to be clear and realistic, as these values shape the company culture, employee behaviors, and both internal and external business practices.</p>

					<h4>Look at what the world needs: </h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Identify specific, important needs that the business can address or help solve to create a better world. For each need, be sure to assign a level of importance and priority based on the company’s values.</p>

					<h4>Define business strengths in relation to what the world needs:</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Take an inventory of business assets that can address and provide solutions to the needs identified – particularly those that rank highest in priority. This will help to provide clarity on where business traction is most likely and whether a distinct, competitive, market position can be achieved.</p>
					<h4>Examine economic value</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Quantify the business opportunities for the top priorities and asset strengths to further isolate the most relevant Purpose-led business focus. This includes evaluating potential revenue, and projecting how much value the business can realistically and profitably capture.</p>
					<div class='row'>
						<div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #ECF0F1;padding: 20px;">
							<h3 style="color:#4f89bb;"><i><strong>Once Purpose is determined, how should it be implemented?</strong></i></h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							
							<p>Purpose should be incorporated into every aspect of a company's business and structure, driving benefits for all of its stakeholders. It should inform robust employee programs; deliver valuable products and services to customers; ensure ethical dealings with suppliers; support local communities; and implement practices for the preservation of our planet.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>The <a href='https://www.sharedvalue.org/purpose-playbook/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>“Purpose Playbook: Putting Purpose into Practice with Shared Value”</a> emphasizes the importance of articulating values and norms – a key outcome of the Purpose construct. It also details the portfolio of practices that comprise a Purpose-led company. This includes Governance; Employee Relations; Supplier Relations; Community Engagement; Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Social Responsibility/Philanthropy; and Sustainability. </p>
					<div class='row'>
						<div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #ECF0F1;padding: 20px;">
							<h3 style="color:#4f89bb;"><i><strong>Why does embarking on Purpose make sense NOW?</strong></i></h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							
							<p>As mentioned, a company’s Purpose provides a strategic compass for long-term planning and the health of the business. Admittedly, it is a process that requires an investment of time and management energy.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p>However, current market issues and stakeholder concerns are requiring companies to act NOW in order to remain relevant and competitive. Here are three specific Purpose-led issues demanding attention:</p>
					<h4>Employee value propositions must be updated.</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">The employer/employee contract must change in order to attract and retain talent. For starters, employees, particularly young professionals, are looking to join and remain at companies whose mission and values they believe in. Employees also expect companies to be welcoming, offering Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives, flexible work arrangements, professional development opportunities, and a safe and respectful work environment for all. However, this is just the beginning. More advanced employee relations efforts include using employee data to create personalization strategies, in effect, deploying the same data-driven disciplines companies use to connect with consumers. </p>

					<h4>Consumer demand for sustainable products and services is driving sales. </h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Research and data indicate that consumers’ appetite for sustainability is on the rise creating demand for new products and services. The Boston Consulting Group reports that 70% of consumers are interested in what brands are doing to develop sustainable products, particularly as it relates to food, drinks, and personal items. In addition, a sustainable focus can yield positive financial results. Hewlett Packard’s <a href='https://www.triplepundit.com/story/2023/hp-sustainable-impact-competitive-edge/781821' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>“big bet on sustainable impact as a competitive edge”</a> realized significant gains. The company reported that $3.5 billion in net sales were influenced by its Sustainable Impact efforts in 2021 – a threefold increase from the prior year.</p>

					<h4>Define business strengths in relation to what the world needs:</h4>
					<p class="mt-2">Take an inventory of business assets that can address and provide solutions to the needs identified – particularly those that rank highest in priority. This will help to provide clarity on where business traction is most likely and whether a distinct, competitive, market position can be achieved.</p>

					<h4>Accuracy is apparently an issue.</h4><br>
					 <p> OpenAI is aware that the current version of ChatGPT does not necessarily deliver "truthful" answers, and as characterized in a piece from <a href='https://colibri.ai/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Coliabri.ai</a>, Chat GPT <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/source-truth-enterprise-chatgpt-nigel-burns/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'> "sometimes writes plausible sounding but incorrect or non-sensical answers.”</a> While this was not my specific experience, it stands to reason. Without real knowledge, ChatGPT cannot distinguish fact from fiction in all the data it mines, nor can it recognize paradoxes and ambiguities.</p>

					<p> As marketers, creativity is often the diamond to our craft, but accuracy is the bedrock. This includes not only building programs based on the right strategy but also referencing sources to support content claims – another capability ChatGPT does not offer right now.</p>

					<h4>Availability.</h4><br>
					 <p> ChatGPT is currently in very high demand, no doubt fueled by all the hype and fascination. At first, I couldn’t access the platform for hours, even after multiple tries. But lately, it's been even worse. So, be prepared for a wait when looking to use ChatGPT. Until there is an expansion of its bandwidth, the delays to use the platform may only get exaggerated. Alternatively, for those who opt to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus, the access problem is likely to be eliminated.</p>

						<div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #ECF0F1;padding: 20px;">
							<h3 style="color:#4f89bb;"><i><strong>What's coming next.</strong></i></h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							<p>The advancements in AI have been rapid and ChatGPT is just one product on the AI train that has left the technology station. As the Internet totally revolutionized media, marketing and communications in the 1990s, so will AI in the years ahead. The evidence is clear as the use of AI has already been hiding in plain sight.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p class="sample-text">
						Apparently, news outlets such as the Associated Press and newswires like Bloomberg, Dow Jones and Reuters have been experimenting with AI for years to support fact-gathering. Meanwhile, <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/27/style/buzzfeed-quiz-ai-chatgpt.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'><strong>Buzzfeed</strong> just announced it plans to use ChatGPT to create quizzes on its site.</a><br><br>

						That said, ChatGPT may very well be a game changer and the seeming motivation behind <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-23/microsoft-makes-multibillion-dollar-investment-in-openai?leadSource=uverify%20wall' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI</a> that include an initial $1 billion in 2019 and a recent $10 billion infusion. ChatGPT is now expected to become part of the Microsoft’s suite of business services, potentially making it a ubiquitous tool in our everyday working. With that, greater functionality is only a matter of time.<br><br>

						<strong>The applications will get much more specific.</strong> Right now, ChatGPT's output is largely generic, but the developers are working to make it more specific. As <a href='https://www.axios.com/2023/01/24/chatgpt-openai-iphone-boom' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Axios</a> points out, "the real power of AI is expected to come when companies and organizations combine AI tools with their own data." As we marketers already know, the marriage of technology platforms and proprietary data is the formula to yield significant results and measurable ROI.<br><br>

						<strong>Greater accuracy is expected.</strong> AI companies – whether it’s OpenAI, Google or Amazon – will keep pushing to improve accuracy. This is expected to be the next big leap in AI but there is no guarantee that the accuracy issue can be completely overcome.
					</p>
					<div class='row'>
						<div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #ECF0F1;padding: 20px;">
							<h3 style="color:#4f89bb;"><i><strong>The opportunities.</strong></i></h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							<p>There is considerable fear that the rise of AI will eliminate the need for people and therefore jobs – including those in marketing. I’d be lying if I didn’t think that might present some level of inevitability. But there are a few significant mitigating factors.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p class="sample-text">
						As previously mentioned, the need for human judgment, which AI does not possess, is essential. Remember, airplanes have been flying on autopilot for years but it’s the captain of an aircraft that still oversees the controls. To quote Maureen in her recent <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/opinion/chatgpt-ai-technology.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'><strong>New York Times column on AI</strong></a>, "The creative spark requires humanity. But soon, A.I. could be sentient.” <br><br>

						For now, ChatGPT is a tool that can help lay the groundwork, informing marketing strategies and supporting the delivery of results. Marketing pros can use it to jumpstart work in expediting information gathering and setting content standards before applying context and creativity to make their end-products uniquely meaningful to clients.<br><br>

						It’s also already clear that the ability to work with AI, just like the ability to work with data analytics, is a needed skill set. According to <a href='https://venturebeat.com/ai/demand-for-ai-skills-on-the-rise-as-fiverr-searches-spike-for-freelancers/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'><strong>VentureBeat</strong></a>, the freelance marketplace Fiverr, has experienced a 1,400% increase in searches for AI-related services over the last six months. This includes looking for talent that can take advantage of AI technologies, including generative AI capabilities for image and text generation to improve marketing, sales and business operations. There is also a new demand for freelancers to help organizations with proofreading and fact checking.<br><br>

						<strong>Greater accuracy is expected.</strong> AI companies – whether it’s OpenAI, Google or Amazon – will keep pushing to improve accuracy. This is expected to be the next big leap in AI but there is no guarantee that the accuracy issue can be completely overcome.

					<div class='row'>
						<div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #ECF0F1;padding: 20px;">
							<h3 style="color:#4f89bb;"><i><strong>The bottom-line.</strong></i></h3>
						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							<p>AI is here to stay and with ChatGPT the game is on. If there's a critical lesson strategic marketers and creative types have learned over the years, it's that it's smarter to embrace new technology than ignore it. Don't fall behind or let yourself be replaced by a new shiny object. Rather, take the time to learn what it can do for you, and then leverage it, to make you a better and more skilled practitioner.</p>

					<h4>Climate change presents financial risk and impacts investing.</h4>
					<p class="sample-text">
						 The perils of climate change – in full display this summer – are raising red flags in the financial marketplace, requiring companies to take more careful note of their climate profiles. 
						
						Banks and insurance companies are re-evaluating their lending, mortgage, and policy guidelines in the face of billions of dollars in property damage and lost value. Meanwhile, Fitch Ratings has estimated that by 2035, <a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/corporate-finance/climate-risk-related-downgrade-may-affect-20-of-global-corporates-by-2035-08-03-2023">20% of global corporations may face credit rating downgrades</a> due to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-01/ratings-firms-struggle-to-quantify-climate-risks-in-bond-market?cmpid=BBD080923_GREENDAILY&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&utm_term=230809&utm_campaign=greendaily">climate vulnerabilities</a>, creating a potential negative impact on the cost of doing business.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="sample-text">
						ESG Investing, an area of explosive growth over the last few years, is also facing headwinds. In ESG rankings, climate-related concerns have typically ranked lower among the metrics evaluated because of inconsistently reported data. As a result, ESG opponents and climate watchers are submitting a growing number of shareholder proposals that take aim at ESG.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="sample-text">
						Inconsistent climate-related reporting is also leading to new <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46#:~:text=The%20Securities%20and%20Exchange%20Commission%20today%20proposed%20rule,in%20a%20note%20to%20their%20audited%20financial%20statements.">SEC disclosure rules</a> expected for release in October. The proposed rules will require listed companies to not only disclose risks likely to have a material impact on their business and operations but also provide information about direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and indirect emissions from purchased electricity or other forms of energy across their entire value chain. 
						
						A similar set of rules is forthcoming in the EU, as the Corporate Social Responsibility Directive <a href="https://www.carbontrust.com/news-and-insights/insights/corporate-sustainability-reporting-directive-csrd-explained">(CSRD)</a> will make companies subject to mandatory sustainability reporting starting in 2024.

						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							Defining a company’s Purpose requires articulating the why of a company, along with its vision and mission. It gets to the heart of a company’s DNA. 
							
							Make no doubt, this is a management initiative and not just a branding and marketing exercise. That said, once determined, it should be broadly communicated.
						</div>
					</div>
					<br>
					<p class="sample-text">
						Visioning workshops are recommended to bring together cross-functional teams to arrive at well-intentioned, well-articulated Purpose statements and jumpstart work on specific Purpose-led initiatives. They also serve to secure buy-in so that Purpose is sure to guide not only all that a company does but also how efforts are delivered.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="sample-text">
						Another next step is to develop customer, employee, and supplier personas that are Purpose-focused. This data will provide new dimensions that inform product development, support employee engagement, and improve the selection and evaluation of supplier relationships. This is an investment in the here and now, and into the future.
					</p>

					<p class="sample-text">
						The return to Purpose is upon us and it’s time to realize its strategic benefits.
