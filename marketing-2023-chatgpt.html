						At the start of each new year, I typically compose an insight looking at the major marketing trends for the 12 months ahead. Over the last few years, these trends have been largely the same – content marketing and automation, customer engagement and personalization, and the ongoing move to digital transformation. The same holds true for 2023.<br><br>

						But what is new this year is the buzz around <a href='https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>ChatGPT.</a><br><br>
						For anybody who might not know, <a href='https://chat.openai.com/chat' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>ChatGPT</a> is the free platform that lets users give directions to a bot that generates content on almost anything, in a variety of forms and styles (a new commercial version, <a href='https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/openai-launches-chatgpt-plus-starting-at-20-per-month/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>ChatGPT Plus,</a> was announced on Feb 1 starting at $20 per month.) Developed by <a href='https://openai.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>OpenAI,</a> a company focused on “shaping the future of technology,” ChatGPT has vast applications. To name just a few: software engineers can use it to direct coding; bankers can use the tool for market and trading analyses; and yes, marketing and communications professionals – from journalists to advertising pros to content creators – can use it to conduct research and draft a range of materials.<br><br>

						So, what does this really mean? And should ChatGPT be welcomed or feared? To get a better understanding, I started experimenting with it and here’s what I found.<br>

						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							<h4>Chat GPT is impressive in its depth.</h4><br>
							<p> Since conducting competitive research is fundamental to marketing, I decided to use ChatGPT and gauge its capabilities in this area. As a pie-in-the-sky test, I asked ChatGPT to provide me with the “best” financial advertising campaigns over the last 20 years and show me ad copy for the launch of a wealth manager in the greater Detroit area. The results were fairly impressive.</p>

					</p>
					<br>
					<div class='row'>
						
						<div class="col-md-6">
							<br><br><p>First, ChatGPT responded by prefacing that my question could only deliver a “subjective” response. It then proceeded to succinctly detail five campaigns that I recall being interesting, if not effective. I appreciated this honest take on reality – nothing artificial about that. <sup>1</sup></p>
							<p>For the ad copy, ChatGPT clearly articulated the foundational issues critical to any wealth management firm. It was also well-written, both from a structural and grammatical perspective, providing a solid baseline effort.</p>

					<h4>It sure is fast.</h4><br>
					<p>In our fast-paced world, time is always of the essence but takes on even more meaning when tight deadlines need to be met. In marketing, this can often be the case for a variety of issues – from developing an ad and drafting a press release to developing a comprehensive go-to-market plan for immediate deployment. ChatGPT’s ability to conduct research in a fraction of manhour time provides an invaluable shortcut. In addition, the rapid production of the copy can also be an advantage, particularly when a content creator suffers from writer’s block!</p>

						</div>
						<div class="col-md-8 mt-sm-20 mt-xs-4">
							<h4>Regardless of its strengths, ChatGP also has limitations.</h4><br>
							<p>While I appreciated ChatGPT’s output (particularly the quick research), it's fair to say that the copy was basically pablum. It read like very generic marketing prose rather than an ad, and it failed to address my regional market query. A recent tweet I reposted from my colleague <a href='https://twitter.com/JakeWengroff' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>@JakeWengroff</a> encapsulates my reaction: “AI writing gets the job done like instant coffee gets the job done.” Or to quote Maureen Dowd in her recent <a href='https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/28/opinion/chatgpt-ai-technology.html?searchResultPosition=1' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>NYT column on AI:</a> “For now, ChatGPT is typing, not writing.”</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<br><br>
					<p>To their credit, <a href='https://www.axios.com/2023/01/23/microsoft-invests-chatgpt-maker-openai' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>OpenAI</a> has admitted ChatGPT has some of these limitations. It points out that the tool “is often excessively verbose” and has issues with accuracy (more on that later) – a healthy reminder that ChatGPT's output is not necessarily gospel. However, it's equally fair to report that OpenAI is committed to addressing the tool's liabilities. On January 31st, the company announced it is testing <a href='https://www.axios.com/2023/01/31/openai-chatgpt-detector-tool-machine-written-text?utm_medium=partner&utm_source=microsoft-start&utm_content=link&utm_campaign=subs-partner-msoft-login' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>a new software tool</a> aimed at identifying AI generated text to tackle rising concerns about copyright infringements and plagiarism.</p>
					<h4>ChatGPT lacks real knowledge and cannot intuit.</h4><br>
					<p> As <a href='https://www.axios.com/2023/01/24/chatgpt-openai-iphone-boom' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Axios</a> points out in a series of articles about ChatGPT, “The AI tool can  <a href='https://www.axios.com/2022/12/05/chatgpt-scary-good-ai-chatbot' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>answer a lot of questions,</a> but it doesn't actually ‘know’ anything.” That explains the point of AI: it’s intelligence but it’s still artificial.</p>

					<p>Knowledge reflects the ability to take information, examine it, and then relate it to experience. ChatGPT can collect and interpret data, but it has no real understanding of what happens in our world or how it operates. Nor does it understand context or offer nuance, which at the end of the day, is the essence of good marketing.</p>

					<h4>Accuracy is apparently an issue.</h4><br>
					 <p> OpenAI is aware that the current version of ChatGPT does not necessarily deliver "truthful" answers, and as characterized in a piece from <a href='https://colibri.ai/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Coliabri.ai</a>, Chat GPT <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/source-truth-enterprise-chatgpt-nigel-burns/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'> "sometimes writes plausible sounding but incorrect or non-sensical answers.”</a> While this was not my specific experience, it stands to reason. Without real knowledge, ChatGPT cannot distinguish fact from fiction in all the data it mines, nor can it recognize paradoxes and ambiguities.</p>

					<p> As marketers, creativity is often the diamond to our craft, but accuracy is the bedrock. This includes not only building programs based on the right strategy but also referencing sources to support content claims – another capability ChatGPT does not offer right now.</p>

					<h4>Availability.</h4><br>
					 <p> ChatGPT is currently in very high demand, no doubt fueled by all the hype and fascination. At first, I couldn’t access the platform for hours, even after multiple tries. But lately, it's been even worse. So, be prepared for a wait when looking to use ChatGPT. Until there is an expansion of its bandwidth, the delays to use the platform may only get exaggerated. Alternatively, for those who opt to subscribe to ChatGPT Plus, the access problem is likely to be eliminated.</p>

							<p>Integrity should reside at the core of any financial firm: from the people in charge, to the infrastructures built, to the very development of digital products customers are looking for, all delivered with a commitment to transparency. This is the great differentiator and the only way to engender trust and ensure that Main Street remains confident in the financial system.</p>

						I would be remiss if I did not credit those FTX competitors who in the face of the meltdown pro-actively communicated to customers. For example, <a href='https://www.coinbase.com/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>Coinbase</a> immediately put out an email focusing on its commitment to "a more transparent and secure crypto exchange" and detailed key attributes including healthy financials, holding customer assets, risk management and industry-leading security.<br><br>

						On that note, let me end with another positive. Amidst the cacophony of last week, I attended a NY PAY webinar, where the issues around digital transformation, were discussed. <a href='https://nypay.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noreferrer'>NY PAY</a> is a non-profit that connects innovators and leaders from the payments industry and all it touches: issuers, merchants, networks, FinTech startups, regulators, and others.<br><br>

						The speakers engaged in a no-holds barred discussion, candid and forthright, identifying the digital transformation approach financial institutions, and largely banks, must take to be truly competitive. Their bottom-line takeaways: no cutting of corners, sufficient due diligence in choosing partners, and committing to serious investments to truly deliver the solutions consumers want and deserve.<br><br>

						Yup, that’s the right answer. It is the integrity of which I speak. From a marketing, communications and reputational perspective, this is the way that financial players and the industry overall must operate to quell naysayers and address customer needs.
